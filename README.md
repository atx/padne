padne is a KiCad-native power delivery network analysis tool. It uses the finite element method in order to simulate the voltage drop induced by DC currents on printed circuit boards. This allows easy identification of resistive bottlenecks, design of high current distribution networks or implementing complex heating elements.

## Key Features
 - **KiCad Native** - Works directly with your existing KiCad projects
 - **2.5D FEM Solver** - Uses the finite element method to quickly solve the Laplace equation
 - **Easy to integrate** - Control via simple text directives in your schematic files
 - **Interactive GUI** - Contains an interactive Qt GUI for exploring the computed solution

## Installation

Two methods are supported at the moment:

### All-in-one binary

Simply download the binary from [here](https://atx.github.io/padne/padne-linux-x64). This comes with all dependencies already bundled. The downside is the relatively large size (around 200MB binary) and some startup time penalty (a few seconds or so).

For a quick start, consider:
```sh
wget https://atx.github.io/padne/padne-linux-x64 
chmod +x padne-linux-x64

# Clone the repository to get the example KiCad projects
git clone git@github.com:atx/padne.git
./padne-linux-x64 gui padne/tests/kicad/via_tht_4layer/via_tht_4layer.kicad_pro
```

This launches a simple GUI that looks like the GIF below.

</p>


### Build-it-yourself

This is ideal if you want to hack on padne itself or are looking for a more lightweight setup. On Ubuntu, we proceed as follows:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install python3-full python3-dev python3-pip libcgal-dev git libegl1 libegl1-mesa-dev kicad
# Feel free to do this in a virtual environment if you do not want to install pygerber or padne globally
pip3 install --user git+https://github.com/Argmaster/pygerber
pip3 install --user -e .[test] -v
```


> [!WARNING]
> On Debian, the build is likely to fail due to invalid CGAL CMake installation. This is best fixed by [installing CGAL manually](https://doc.cgal.org/latest/Manual/installation.html) from sources.

## Running the solver

Simply do:

```
padne gui my_project.kicad_pro
```

There is also a capability for saving a solution and displaying it later:

```
padne solve my_project.kicad_pro pdn.padne
padne show pdn.padne
```

> [!TIP]
> Run `padne gui --help` to see the exposed solver parameters.

## Usage



padne is controlled by placing special text directives inside your KiCad schematic file. The idea is that you use these directives to wire up lumped elements (voltage sources, current sources etc.) to your PCB geometry.

### Lumped element directives

These directives specify a discrete lumped element connected to somewhere in the geometry.

For endpoints
 * The format is `DESIGNATOR.PAD`, such as `R1.1` or `U14.A2`
 * It is possible to specify multiple pads as a comma-separated list, such as `p=R1.1,R2.1`

For values
 * SI prefixes and units are supported, such as `1k` or `500mA`

#### VOLTAGE

Creates an ideal voltage source between the specified terminals

**Parameters:**
- `p=ENDPOINTS` - Positive terminal(s)
- `n=ENDPOINTS` - Negative terminal(s)
- `v=VALUE` - Voltage

For example:
```
!padne VOLTAGE v=3.3V p=U1.VCC n=U1.GND
```

#### CURRENT

Creates an ideal current source flowing from one terminal to another.

**Parameters:**
- `f=ENDPOINTS` - From terminal(s) (current source)
- `t=ENDPOINTS` - To terminal(s) (current sink) 
- `i=VALUE` - Current magnitude
- `coupling=VALUE` - (Optional) Coupling resistance, for multi-pad terminals

For example:
```
!padne CURRENT i=1.0A f=R2.1 t=R2.2
!padne CURRENT i=3A f=TP2.1,TP3.1,TP4.1 t=TP1.1 coupling=1
```

#### RESISTANCE

Creates a resistor between two terminals.

**Parameters:**
- `a=ENDPOINTS` - Terminal A
- `b=ENDPOINTS` - Terminal B  
- `r=VALUE` - Resistance value
- `coupling=VALUE` - (Optional) Coupling resistance, for multi-pad terminals

For example:
```
!padne RESISTANCE r=0.1 a=R2.1 b=R2.2
!padne RESISTANCE r=10000 a=R3.1,R2.1 b=R3.2 coupling=0.1
```

#### REGULATOR

This is effectively a current-controlled current source, that can also set a voltage between its "sense" terminals. This is useful for modeling dependent sources, such as LDOs or DCDC converters.


**Parameters:**
- `p=ENDPOINTS` - Positive voltage sense
- `n=ENDPOINTS` - Negative voltage sense  
- `f=ENDPOINTS` - Current source terminal (from)
- `t=ENDPOINTS` - Current sink terminal (to)
- `v=VALUE` - Target voltage (V_p - V_n = v)
- `gain=VALUE` - Current gain factor
- `coupling=VALUE` - (Optional) Coupling resistance, for multi-pad terminals

The idea is that you pre-compute the gain factor based on the nominal values for the regulator input voltage, output voltage and efficiency. For example, for an LDO, the gain is always equal to 1. For a DCDC converter switching from 12V to 5V, with efficiency of 80%, the gain factor would be about 0.52). This is illustrated by the schematic below:

### Specifying multiple pads

The directives support specifying multiple physical pads connected to a single lumped element node. Internally, this is implemented by  connecting the pads by small resistors in a "star" topology. Note that for a single pad, these resistors are omitted. For voltage sources, they are always omitted and the coupling is implemented by 0V voltage sources.

This is particularly useful for specifying multi-pad consumers (where you do not care or even know which pads are going to be ingesting the specified current) or switching elements with intrinsic internal resistance, such as multi-pad transistors. For example, this directive:
```
!padne CURRENT i=1.5A f=U1.12,U1.3,U1.21 t=U1.15,U1.5
```
results in the following lumped elements being wired into the mesh:

Note that the resistance of the coupling resistors can be adjusted by the optional `coupling` parameter (defaults to 1mÎ©).
